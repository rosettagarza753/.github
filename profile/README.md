### 💡 Approach to Development  

I believe in writing clean, modular, and well-documented code. I prioritize performance optimization, security, and user experience in every project. Collaboration is key, and I enjoy working in agile environments where continuous integration/deployment (CI/CD) is the norm. I’m a firm believer in test-driven development (TDD) and strive to write meaningful tests for every feature.
